  const discReplacementFaqs = [
    {
      q: "What exactly is disc replacement surgery?",
      a: "The surgeon removes a damaged spinal disc and inserts a man‑made implant that mimics a healthy disc’s height and motion—so your spine keeps bending and twisting instead of being locked in place.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is it different from spinal fusion?",
      a: "Fusion bolts two bones together, sacrificing motion to stop pain. Disc replacement preserves motion, which often means quicker recovery, less stress on nearby levels, and a more natural feel.",
    },
    {
      q: "Am I a good candidate?",
      a: "You’re likely a candidate if one or two discs are the main pain generators, you have no major facet‑joint arthritis or instability, and you’ve tried non‑surgical options for at least a few months.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long does the artificial disc last?",
      a: "Current research shows modern implants holding strong well past 15–20 years. Think of it like a hip or knee replacement—built to go the distance.",
    },
    {
      q: "What’s the recovery time?",
      a: "Most patients walk the same day, drive in about a week, return to desk work in 1–2 weeks, and hit the gym (smartly) in 6–8 weeks—depending on your exact job and fitness level.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will I lose flexibility?",
      a: "Nope—that’s the point. An artificial disc is designed to keep your neck or back moving almost like factory‑fresh hardware.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is the surgery safe?",
      a: "Yes. Complication rates are low, especially in experienced hands. We monitor nerves in real time and use X‑ray guidance to place the implant precisely.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is disc replacement covered by insurance?",
      a: "Many insurers now cover cervical disc replacements. Lumbar coverage varies by plan. Our team checks your benefits and secures pre‑authorization before surgery day.",
    },
    {
      q: "When can I get back to sports or heavy lifting?",
      a: "Light cardio in a couple of weeks, strength training around two months, and contact sports after your post‑op imaging clears you—usually three months or so.",
    },

            What is Disc Replacement Surgery?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Disc replacement surgery involves removing a worn or damaged spinal
            disc and replacing it with an artificial one designed to mimic
            natural movement. Unlike traditional spinal fusion, which locks two
            bones together, disc replacement keeps your spine flexible — helping
            you move more freely with less long-term impact.

      a: "If you suspect a fracture—especially after a fall or injury—immobilize the area, avoid putting weight on it, and seek immediate medical attention.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is surgery always needed for fractures?",
      a: "Not always. Many fractures heal with casting or splinting, but some need surgical fixation with plates, screws, or rods to ensure proper healing.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is trauma care exactly?",
      a: "Trauma care involves emergency treatment of injuries caused by accidents, falls, or impacts—ranging from fractures to soft tissue damage and internal injuries.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long is the recovery for broken bones?",
      a: "Depending on the location and severity, bones typically heal in 6–12 weeks. Rehab and follow-ups are essential to regain full strength and function.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can kids and older adults get different treatment?",
      a: "Yes—children's bones heal faster and may need different techniques, while older adults often need more support due to weaker bones and slower healing.",

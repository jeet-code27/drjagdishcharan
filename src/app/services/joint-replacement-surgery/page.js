    {
      q: "Will I be in pain after the surgery?",
      a: "You’ll have some discomfort at first, but pain relief begins almost immediately. Most patients say post-op pain is nothing compared to the constant pain they had before surgery.",

      q: "How long is the recovery time?",
      a: "Most patients are up and walking the same day or next, and return to most activities in 6 to 12 weeks. Full recovery and strength may take a few months.",

      q: "Will I need physical therapy?",
